<h4> And it's Think of a document that you would create in a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. They usually consist of more than one style. They use different font sizes to indicate different section of the text, like headers, main content, footers, table of contents, captions, and so on.

    Whereas a human can simply look at a document and understand the difference between a heading and a paragraph, computers have no such intuition. In order to render correctly a web page, it must be explicitly told what each piece of content is.
    
    So how exactly do we tell the browser to display a content? This is where Hyper Text Markup Langauge (or HTML for short) comes in handy.
    
    HTML is the language in which most websites are written. It is used to create pages and make them functional.</h4>

<h4>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</h4>

   <h4>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.

    JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</h4>
